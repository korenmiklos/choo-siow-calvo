# Research Discussion Summary: Variance-Covariance Decomposition for CEO-Firm Sorting

*Date: October 17, 2025*  
*Project: Hungarian CEO-Firm Matching Analysis*

## 1. Key Bugs to Fix

### Primary Technical Issues

**Four-Step Path Construction Error**
- Current estimation yields implausibly high correlations (ρ ≈ 0.99) indicating numerical instability
- **Root cause**: When constructing 4-step manager-manager paths, we may be including non-independent paths where managers A and B share multiple firms, creating spurious correlation
- **Solution**: Ensure 4-step paths represent the shortest walk of length 4 between manager pairs, excluding any pairs with shorter connections

**Data Preprocessing Issues**
- Remove year fixed effects from all log revenue observations before computing moments
- Apply consistent demeaning to all variables when computing covariances and variances, even when comparing groups with potentially different means (e.g., starting vs. continuing managers)
- The large sample size makes degrees of freedom corrections unnecessary

**Expected Correlation Range**
- Believable correlations should range from 0.6-0.8, potentially up to 0.8, but not 0.99
- The finding that manager effect variance is about 1/10th of firm effect variance is credible and consistent with prior evidence
- Substantial but not excessive noise (σ_ε) is expected and methodologically important for bias correction

## 2. Paper Structure

### Target Audience and Format
**Venue**: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)
- Emphasizes novel methodology with network analysis techniques
- Features 30 years of universe-level Hungarian CEO-firm data
- Faster publication timeline than economics journals
- Less demanding revision process
- Focus on single, clear contribution rather than comprehensive robustness

**Alternative Outlets**: Nature Human Behaviour if PNAS rejects

### Proposed Paper Organization

**Section 1: Cross-Sectional Analysis**
- Start analysis from 2004 (post-EU accession) for cleaner institutional environment
- Pool all years after 2004 for initial demonstration
- Intuitive explanation of correlation identification through covariance decay
- Include illustrative TikZ figure showing network hops and covariance relationships at 2-step and 4-step distances

**Section 2: Time Series Analysis**
- Use 3-year rolling windows (potentially 5-year if insufficient variation)
- Ten windows provide suitable time series for graphical presentation
- Track parameter evolution over transition period
- Document whether correlation normalizes at higher level after initial transition turmoil

**Section 3: Model Validation and Extensions**
- Five moments, four parameters provide overidentification test
- Assess model fit across time series
- Optional: Test parameter restrictions (e.g., constant variances, only correlation changing)

## 3. Target Outlet Rationale

**PNAS Advantages**:
- Values novel methodological contributions
- Appreciates large-scale administrative data (30-year universe)
- Interested in network analysis techniques
- Faster review process than economics journals
- Shorter format requirements align with focused contribution
- Less pressure for extensive robustness checks

**Audience Fit**: General science audience values simple descriptive models with few parameters and clear intuitive explanations

## 4. Main Findings Expected

### Correlation Estimates
- Expect relatively high but believable correlation (ρ = 0.6-0.8)
- Much higher than worker-firm correlations in labor literature
- Interpret as evidence of strong positive sorting: fourth-degree network neighbors work at very similar firms

### Variance Decomposition
- Low variance of CEO effects relative to firm effects (confirmed pattern)
- When combined with high correlation, CEO contribution to firm performance should be substantial in R-squared terms
- Expected to be lower than fixed-effects estimates due to bias correction, but still substantial

### Time Evolution
- Lower correlation in early 1990s transitional period
- Stabilization at higher level indicating reduced information frictions and more efficient markets
- Relatively stable variance components over time

## 5. Exhibits/Figures Needed

### Network Description
- Table of network statistics: number of firms, managers, giant component size
- Standard network summary statistics for each time window

### Methodological Illustration
- **Key figure**: TikZ diagram showing firm-manager network with 2-step and 4-step paths
- Visual explanation of covariance decay identification strategy
- Network hops between firms and managers with covariance annotations

### Results Tables
- Parameter estimates across all time windows
- Model fit comparison: observed vs. predicted moments
- Robustness checks and specification tests

### Time Series Analysis
- Evolution of correlation parameter over 10 windows
- Stability of variance components
- Graphical presentation of parameter trends

## 6. Counterfactuals

### Primary Policy Experiment
**Question**: How much did increasing correlation contribute to Hungarian GDP growth?

**Method**: 
- Use lognormal distributional assumption for closed-form calculation
- Mean of lognormal depends on variance of logarithm (exp[0.5 × variance] enters mean)
- Higher sorting increases variance and thereby mean output
- **Specific counterfactual**: If correlation remained at early 1990s level, how much lower would gross output be today?

**Implementation**: 
- Model-based calculation, not simulation-based
- Plug estimated parameters into closed-form formula
- Generate headline number for abstract and policy discussion

### Optional Extensions
- Perfect sorting counterfactual (correlation = 1) to measure distance from efficiency frontier
- Alternative distribution assumptions
- Cannot estimate means directly (have only trivial effects anyway)

## 7. Literature to Cite

### Strict Citation Limits
**Maximum 12 citations total** - this is not a literature review

### Required Citations (Maximum 3-4 each category)
**Labor Literature**:
- Worker-firm correlation studies (maximum 3-4 papers)
- Focus on baseline comparison, not comprehensive review

**CEO Literature**: 
- Strategic management and corporate finance journals (maximum 3-4 papers) 
- Earlier estimates of CEO effects and R-squared measures

**Methodology**:
- Gregory Clark genetics paper (path-length approach)
- Authors' own work with Almoch and Christina (event study method, ~20% R-squared comparison)

**Misallocation**:
- Cher and Clino classical papers on input misallocation across firms
- Any manager-related misallocation studies if available (maximum 3 total)

### Literature Strategy
- Comment on how fixed-effects approaches overestimate R-squared due to bias
- Compare to event study estimates showing 5-6% causal CEO effects
- Position results relative to worker-firm matching literature
- Minimal literature review - focus on comparison points only

## 8. Optional Extensions

### Higher-Order Network Paths
- Include 6-step, 8-step covariances as additional moments
- Test overidentifying restrictions from longer paths
- Model prediction: h-step covariances = ρ^(h-2) × 2-step covariances
- Assess robustness of core results

### Alternative Outcomes
- Estimate model using log value added instead of revenue for direct GDP measurement
- Check sensitivity to accounting practices and measurement

### Noise Bias Illustration
- Show biases introduced by ignoring match-specific noise component
- Demonstrate importance of bias correction for accurate correlation estimates
- Include in first application if time permits

### Cross-Country Extensions
- Apply identical methodology to Germany and Austria data
- Compare sorting parameters across countries
- Highlight potential for future comparative work
- Not included in current paper but mentioned for future research

### Model Fit Extensions
- Test parameter restrictions (constant variances, changing correlation only)
- Assess fit with parsimonious models preferred by PNAS audience
- Use overidentification tests for specification validation

## Implementation Notes
