## Notes copied from B2.texTo study how managers with skill $z$ and firms with productivity $a$ match, consider a manager $m$ is contemplating job offers from various firms. At firm $i$, they would make wage $w_{im}$. Their overall utility from working for firm $i$ is$$V_{im} = w_{im} - \tau_{im} - \sigma \xi_{im},$$where $\tau_{im}$ is the observed cost of working for firm $i$ (say, commuting costs increasing in distance to the firm), and $\xi_{im}$ is an unobserved, idiosyncratic matching cost with a standard Gumbel distribution \pcite{Choo2006-ki,Galichon2019-gi}. Importantly, the matching cost is independent of firm and manager quality $a_i$ and $z_m$ and observed matching cost $\tau_{im}$.Before knowing the realization of the matching cost, the probability that the manager chooses firm $i$ is given by a logit equation,$$\pi_{im} = \frac {e^{(w_{im}-\tau_{im})/\sigma}}  {\sum_j e^{(w_{jm}-\tau_{jm})/\sigma}}.$$The profit of the firm from hiring manager $m$ is$$J_{im} = a_i z_m - w_{im} - \sigma \varepsilon_{im},$$where $\varepsilon_{im}$ is a firm-specific matching cost of the \emph{same distribution} as, but independently draw from $\xi$. We have used the simple match-specific production $a_iz_m$, but other specifications can also be included.Before knowing the realization of the matching cost, the probability that the firm chooses manager $m$ is given by a logit equation,$$\Pi_{im} = \frac {e^{(a_i z_m - w_{im})/\sigma}}  {\sum_k e^{(a_iz_k - w_{ik})/\sigma}}.$$For a match to form, both the firm and the manager has to agree. The probability that both find each other suitable is$$\mu_{im} = \pi_{im}\Pi_{im} = \frac {e^{(a_i z_m - \tau_{im})/\sigma}}  {\phi_i \Phi_m}.$$The joint distribution $\mu_{im}$ shows the equilibrium likelihood of matches between a particular firm $i$ and manager $m$ and how this depends on productivity, manager skill and frictions.There is positive assortative matching: better managers are more likely to match with better firms. The parameter $\sigma$ captures the strength of the sorting. If there is a large heterogeneity in matching costs, $\sigma$ is large, and sorting is weaker. At the other extreme, as $\sigma$ tends to zero, sorting becomes perfect: the best managers are only matched with the best firms.[[ERC-2023-AdG]] [[ERC-2023-AdG]]Try a parametric distribution for $\mu(a,z)$. We know that$$\mu(a,z) = e^{az/\sigma}\Phi(a)\phi(z)$$(with different parametrization).$$\ln\mu(a,z) = \frac{az}{\sigma} + \ln \Phi(a) + \ln\phi(z)$$The conditional distribution is$$\mu(z|a) = \frac {e^{az/\sigma}\phi(z)}	{\int_x e^{ax/\sigma}\phi(x)dx}.$$Can this have an infinite support over $z$? A necessary but not sufficient condition is that$$\lim_{z\to\infty} \mu(z|a) = 0,$$so that $\phi(z)$ has to decrease faster than exponential with coefficient $-a/\sigma$.The gamma distribution is parametrized as$$f(x)=\frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta x }$$A multivariate gamma is the [matrix gamma distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_gamma_distribution)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_familyLet $\mu(a,z|a)$ be an exponential distribution with ???### Pareto$$\ln f(x) = \ln\alpha +\alpha\ln x_m-(\alpha+1)\ln x$$not looking good### Normal$$\ln f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\ln(2\pi) - \frac{1}{2}\ln\sigma^2 - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\mu^2- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}x^2+ \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\mu x$$MLR shifting it with $ax/\sigma$ (a different $\sigma$ though) amounts to shifting the mean of the distribution.Write down a bivariate normal distribution for $a$ and $z$ and show how $\sigma$ is linked to the correlation.$$\mu(a,z) = e^{az/\sigma}\Phi(a)\phi(z)$$Let $a$ be exponential conditional on $z$:$$\mu(a|z) = (\lambda-z/\sigma) e^{-(\lambda-z/\sigma) a}$$> It may be possible to derive a nice parametric distribution
