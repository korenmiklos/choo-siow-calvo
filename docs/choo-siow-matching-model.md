Managers have a distribution of skills, $z \sim G(z)$. Firms have a distribution of productivities $a \sim F(a)$. When a manager and a firm matches, they produce an output of $az$. The distributions and the production function are time invariant.At any given point in time, there is a stock of unmatched managers, unmatched firms, and manager-firm matches. Given the constant $F$ and $G$ distributions, matching can be charactezied by the joint measure of matches, $\mu(a, z, t)$.$$F(a) = \int \mu(a, z, t)dz + \mu_1(a,t)$$and$$G(z) = \int \mu(a, z, t)da + \mu_2(z,t).$$Each match is dissolved by a Calvo fairy at a Poisson rate $\delta$, independent of $a$ and $z$. This creates an outflow from $\mu$ into $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. ### ManagersUnemployed managers can a look for a job with Poisson arrival $\lambda$. They then get a draw of a match-specific cost for each unmatched firm. This cost is $\sigma\xi$, where $\xi$ is distributed independtly across potential firm matches with a standard Gumbel distribution and $\sigma>0$ is a parameter.Which firm will the manager choose? The value of working for firm $a$ is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation,$$\rho V(a,z,t) = w(a,z,t) - \delta [V(a,z,t) - V_0(z,t)],$$where $V_0$ is the value of being an unemployed manager.$$V(a,z,t) = \frac  {w(a,z,t)+\delta V_0(z,t)} {\rho+\delta}$$The value net of matching cost is $$\frac  {w(a,z,t)+\delta V_0(z,t)} {\rho+\delta} - \sigma \xi$$Denote $W := w/(\rho+\delta)$ the perpetual value of wages.Before knowing the realization of the matching cost, the probability that the manager chooses firm $a$ is given by a logit equation,$$\pi(a,z,t) = \frac {e^{W(a,z,t)/\sigma}e^{\varrho V_0/\sigma}}  {e^{V_0/\sigma}+\int e^{W(A,z,t)/\sigma}e^{\varrho V_0/\sigma}dA},$$$$= \frac {e^{W(a,z,t)/\sigma}}  {e^{(1-\varrho)V_0(z,t)/\sigma}+\int e^{W(A,z,t)/\sigma}dA},$$with $\varrho = \delta/(\delta+\rho)\in(0,1)$.The probabilty of the manager choosing to remain unemployed is $\pi_0(z,t) = e^{V_0/\sigma}/[e^{V_0/\sigma}+\int e^{W(A,z,t)/\sigma}e^{\varrho V_0/\sigma}dA]$. The relative probabilities are$$\frac {\pi(a,z,t)}	{\pi_0(z,t)}=e^{W(a,z,t)/\sigma}e^{(\varrho-1) V_0(z,t)/\sigma}$$Suppose all willing managers are hired (we will verify this in equilibrium). Then the Kolmogorov equations are$$\dot \mu(a,z,t) = \lambda\pi(a,z,t)\mu_2(z,t) - \delta \mu(a,z,t)$$and$$\dot \mu_2(z,t) = -\lambda [1-\pi_0(z,t)]\mu_2(z,t) + \delta\int \mu(a,z,t)da.$$A $1-\pi_0$ fraction of potential matches will be attractive enough to go back to work, reducing the mass of unemployed managers. All kinds of employed managers are fired with hazard $\delta$.In steady state,$$\mu_2^*(z) = \frac {\delta}	{\lambda [1-\pi_0^*(z)]} \int \mu^*(a,z)da	$$and$$\mu^*(a,z) = \frac {\pi^*(a,z)}	{1-\pi_0^*(z)} \int \mu^*(A,z)dA.$$This looks promising! The key object of interest is $$\frac {\pi^*(a,z)}	{1-\pi_0^*(z)}	= \frac {e^{W^*(a,z)/\sigma}e^{\varrho V_0^*/\sigma}}  {\int e^{W^*(A,z)/\sigma}e^{\varrho V_0^*/\sigma}dA}$$and the $V_0$ term cancels so that$$\tag{*}\mu^*(a,z) = \frac {e^{W^*(a,z)/\sigma}}  {\int e^{W^*(A,z)/\sigma}dA}\int \mu^*(A,z)dA= e^{W^*(a,z)/\sigma} \phi(z).$$### FirmsThe value of a firm is$$\rho J(a,z,t) = az - w(a,z,t) - \delta[J(a,z,t) - J_0(a,t)],$$with$$J(a,z,t) = \frac{az}{\rho+\delta} -W(a,z,t) + \varrho J_0(a,t).$$Denoting $Q(a,z):=az/(ρ+δ)$ and using the same steps as above$$\tag{**}\mu^*(a,z) = \frac {e^{[Q(a,z)-W^*(a,z)]/\sigma}}  {\int e^{[Q(a,Z)-W^*(a,Z)]/\sigma}dZ}\int \mu^*(a,Z)dZ= e^{[Q(a,z)-W^*(a,z)]/\sigma}\Phi(a).$$We have used the fact that matching is one to one, so $\mu(a,z)$ is the same whether we calculate from flows of managers or flows of firms.Take the geometric average of (\*) and (\*\*):$$\mu^*(a,z) =  e^{Q(a,z)/2\sigma}\sqrt{\phi(z)\Phi(a)}.$$This is the Choo-Siow formula!
