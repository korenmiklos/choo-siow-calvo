\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We develop a method-of-moments approach to quantify sorting between firm and manager types using only firm-level revenues and mobility links between managers and firms. The method exploits a variance--covariance decomposition implied by a random-effects model with correlation between firm effects and manager effects. Identification relies on covariances of log revenues across manager--manager and firm--firm pairs at different path lengths in the projected mobility network. We outline the model, derive moment formulas for 2-step and 4-step links, describe an estimation strategy that is overidentified, and detail an implementation plan for a 30-year panel of Hungarian CEO--firm matches.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}
Understanding the strength of assortative matching between firms and managers is central to assessing allocative efficiency and its evolution over time. Existing approaches often require estimating high-dimensional fixed effects or structural models. We propose a simpler, transparent alternative based on second moments of log revenues and the topology of the mobility network. The key object of interest is the correlation between firm and manager types, which we denote by $\rho$. Higher $\rho$ indicates tighter sorting and, under standard models of assignment with complementarities, more efficient allocation.

\section{Model and Assumptions}
\label{sec:model}
Consider matches between firms $i$ and managers $m$ observed within short, non-overlapping windows (e.g., three-year windows). Let $y_{im}$ denote the log revenue of firm $i$ under manager $m$ aggregated within a window. We posit the decomposition
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model}
 y_{im} = a_i + z_m + \varepsilon_{im},
\end{equation}
where $a_i$ is a log firm effect, $z_m$ is a log manager effect, and $\varepsilon_{im}$ is a match-specific disturbance. We assume:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(a_i, z_m)$ are jointly centered with $\mathbb{E}[a_i]=\mathbb{E}[z_m]=0$, variances $\operatorname{Var}(a_i)=\sigma_a^2$, $\operatorname{Var}(z_m)=\sigma_z^2$, and covariance $\operatorname{Cov}(a_i,z_m)=\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z$ with $\rho\in[-1,1]$.
  \item Conditional independence along links: conditional on a firm type $a$, manager types hired by that firm in a window are independent draws from the conditional distribution of $z\mid a$; analogously, conditional on a manager type $z$, firm types worked at by that manager are independent draws from $a\mid z$.
  \item Joint normality of $(a,z)$, or more generally a linear conditional expectation structure, so that
  \begin{equation}
   \mathbb{E}[z\mid a] = \frac{\rho\,\sigma_z}{\sigma_a}a,\qquad \mathbb{E}[a\mid z] = \frac{\rho\,\sigma_a}{\sigma_z}z.
  \end{equation}
  \item $\varepsilon_{im}$ is mean-zero, independent across matches, and independent of $(a_i, z_m)$, with variance $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$. Within a short window, time aggregation may reduce transitory noise; our identification relies only on cross-match independence of $\varepsilon$.
\end{itemize}
Parameters of interest are $\theta=(\sigma_a,\sigma_z,\rho,\sigma_\varepsilon)$.

\section{Moments from the Mobility Network}
We represent the data within a window as a bipartite graph between firms and managers. Projecting the bipartite graph onto the manager (respectively firm) side yields an undirected graph where an edge connects two managers (firms) if they have worked at the same firm (manager) within the window. Paths of even length in these projections capture higher-order co-employment relationships.

\subsection{Cross-sectional variance}
Unconditionally across matches, the variance of $y$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var}
 V \equiv \operatorname{Var}(y) = \sigma_a^2 + \sigma_z^2 + 2\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z + \sigma_\varepsilon^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Two-step covariances (direct neighbors)}
Consider two managers $m$ and $m'$ who worked at the same firm $i$ (manager--manager link at distance 2). Under the model,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mm2}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{im'}) = \sigma_a^2 + 2\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\,\sigma_z^2.
\end{equation}
Similarly, for two firms $i$ and $i'$ that have been run by the same manager $m$ (firm--firm link at distance 2),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ff2}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{i'm}) = \sigma_z^2 + 2\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\,\sigma_a^2.
\end{equation}
These expressions follow from the law of total covariance and the linear conditional expectation structure. Intuitively, at distance 2 the side shared by the pair (firm for manager--manager; manager for firm--firm) enters with full variance, while the opposite side is ``projected'' through $\rho$ and enters with dampening $\rho^2$.

\subsection{Four-step covariances (second neighbors)}
Now consider manager--manager pairs connected by a length-4 path in the manager projection, i.e., $m$ and $m'$ worked at firms $i$ and $i'$, respectively, and there exists an intermediate manager $\tilde m$ such that $m$ and $\tilde m$ share firm $i$ and $\tilde m$ and $m'$ share firm $i'$. Following \citet{Clark2023}, who used longer genealogical paths to measure intergenerational correlation of social status, we exploit the fact that each step introduces a factor of $\rho$, so the 4-step covariance is simply $\rho^2$ times the 2-step covariance:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mm4}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{i'm'}) = \rho^2 \cdot \operatorname{Cov}_{\text{mm},2} = \rho^2(\sigma_a^2 + 2\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\,\sigma_z^2).
\end{equation}
By symmetry, for firm--firm pairs connected by a length-4 path in the firm projection,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ff4}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{i'm'}) = \rho^2 \cdot \operatorname{Cov}_{\text{ff},2} = \rho^2(\sigma_z^2 + 2\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\,\sigma_a^2).
\end{equation}
This simple structure reveals that the ratio of 4-step to 2-step covariances directly identifies $\rho^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rho-ratio}
 \rho^2 = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}_{\text{mm},4}}{\operatorname{Cov}_{\text{mm},2}} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}_{\text{ff},4}}{\operatorname{Cov}_{\text{ff},2}}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Proof sketch for \eqref{eq:mm4}.} Write $y_{im}=a_i+z_m+\varepsilon_{im}$ and $y_{i'm'}=a_{i'}+z_{m'}+\varepsilon_{i'm'}$. By independence of $\varepsilon$,
\begin{align*}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{i'm'}) &= \operatorname{Cov}(a_i, a_{i'}) + \operatorname{Cov}(a_i, z_{m'}) + \operatorname{Cov}(z_m, a_{i'}) + \operatorname{Cov}(z_m, z_{m'}).
\end{align*}
The path $m \leftrightarrow i \leftrightarrow \tilde m \leftrightarrow i' \leftrightarrow m'$ connects these terms through iterated conditional expectations. Using $\mathbb{E}[z\mid a] = \rho(\sigma_z/\sigma_a)a$ and $\mathbb{E}[a\mid z] = \rho(\sigma_a/\sigma_z)z$, we have $\mathbb{E}[a_{i'}\mid a_i] = \rho^2 a_i$ (two steps through $z_{\tilde m}$), $\mathbb{E}[z_{m'}\mid a_i] = \rho^3(\sigma_z/\sigma_a)a_i$, and $\mathbb{E}[z_{m'}\mid z_m] = \rho^4 z_m$ (four steps). Therefore,
\begin{align*}
 \operatorname{Cov}(y_{im}, y_{i'm'}) &= \rho^2\sigma_a^2 + 2\rho^3\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^4\sigma_z^2 = \rho^2(\sigma_a^2 + 2\rho\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\sigma_z^2) = \rho^2 \operatorname{Cov}_{\text{mm},2}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Excess-variance identities}
A useful rearrangement removes components that are common to the 2-step covariances. Subtracting \eqref{eq:mm2} and \eqref{eq:ff2} from the total variance \eqref{eq:var} yields
\begin{align}
\label{eq:excess-mm2}
 V - \operatorname{Cov}_{\text{mm},2} &= (1-\rho^2)\,\sigma_z^2 + \sigma_\varepsilon^2, \\
\label{eq:excess-ff2}
 V - \operatorname{Cov}_{\text{ff},2} &= (1-\rho^2)\,\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_\varepsilon^2.
\end{align}
Because covariances purge the match disturbance, these identities isolate a combination of the same-side variance and the noise variance. Higher-order analogues can be constructed, but for identification we will use the 2-step and 4-step covariances directly.

\section{Identification and Estimation}
\label{sec:ident}
Equations \eqref{eq:var}--\eqref{eq:ff4} provide five moment conditions for four parameters $\theta=(\sigma_a,\sigma_z,\rho,\sigma_\varepsilon)$. The system is overidentified, and the simple ratio structure \eqref{eq:rho-ratio} permits constructive estimation.

\subsection{Constructive Estimation via Covariance Ratios}
\label{sec:constructive}
The ratio \eqref{eq:rho-ratio} provides a direct estimator of $\rho^2$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rho2-est}
 \widehat{\rho^2} = \frac{\widehat C_{\text{mm},4}}{\widehat C_{\text{mm},2}} \quad \text{or} \quad \widehat{\rho^2} = \frac{\widehat C_{\text{ff},4}}{\widehat C_{\text{ff},2}}.
\end{equation}
With two independent estimates from manager and firm projections, we can take an average or test for consistency. This ratio estimator has an appealing interpretation: it is equivalent to the coefficient from an instrumental variables regression.

\paragraph{Interpretation via path attenuation.} The ratio structure has an intuitive interpretation: as we move further in the network (from 2 steps to 4 steps), the covariance attenuates by exactly $\rho^2$. This is because each additional "hop" through the matching process introduces one factor of $\rho$. A 4-step path requires two hops beyond the direct 2-step connection, hence the $\rho^2$ attenuation.

More formally, consider the correlation structure along the path $m_1 \leftrightarrow i \leftrightarrow m_2 \leftrightarrow i' \leftrightarrow m_3$. The outcomes $y_{i1}$ and $y_{i'3}$ are connected only through their correlation with the intermediate firm types $a_i$ and $a_{i'}$, which are themselves connected through $z_{m_2}$. Each link in this chain contributes a factor of $\rho$ to the correlation, giving $\rho^2$ for the complete path.

\paragraph{Why IV works.} The key insight is that 2-step covariances contain both the systematic components $(\sigma_a^2, \sigma_z^2, \rho)$ and are free of $\varepsilon$ contamination, while 4-step covariances scale all systematic components by exactly $\rho^2$. Taking ratios cancels all variance and cross-product terms:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{C_{\text{mm},4}}{C_{\text{mm},2}} = \frac{\rho^2(\sigma_a^2 + 2\rho\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\sigma_z^2)}{\sigma_a^2 + 2\rho\sigma_a\sigma_z + \rho^2\sigma_z^2} = \rho^2.
\end{equation}
The numerator and denominator contain identical combinations of variances, so the ratio is parameter-free except for $\rho^2$.

\paragraph{Sequential estimation.} Given $\widehat\rho$, the excess-variance identities \eqref{eq:excess-mm2} and \eqref{eq:excess-ff2} yield
\begin{align}
\label{eq:seq-est}
 \widehat\sigma_z^2 &= \frac{\widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{mm},2} - \widehat\sigma_\varepsilon^2}{1 - \widehat\rho^2}, \\
 \widehat\sigma_a^2 &= \frac{\widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{ff},2} - \widehat\sigma_\varepsilon^2}{1 - \widehat\rho^2}.
\end{align}
Subtracting these gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff-sigma}
 \widehat\sigma_z^2 - \widehat\sigma_a^2 = \frac{\widehat C_{\text{ff},2} - \widehat C_{\text{mm},2}}{1 - \widehat\rho^2}.
\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{eq:diff-sigma} with \eqref{eq:mm2} or \eqref{eq:ff2} solves for $\widehat\sigma_a$ and $\widehat\sigma_z$. Finally, $\widehat\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ follows from \eqref{eq:var}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eps-est}
 \widehat\sigma_\varepsilon^2 = \widehat V - \widehat\sigma_a^2 - \widehat\sigma_z^2 - 2\widehat\rho\,\widehat\sigma_a\widehat\sigma_z.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Summary of constructive estimator.}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Estimate $\rho^2$ from covariance ratios \eqref{eq:rho2-est}, taking the sign from the 2-step covariances.
 \item Solve for $\sigma_a^2$ and $\sigma_z^2$ using \eqref{eq:diff-sigma} and sum constraints from 2-step covariances.
 \item Recover $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ as the residual from total variance \eqref{eq:eps-est}.
\end{enumerate}
This constructive approach is computationally trivial and provides closed-form estimates with transparent identification.

\subsection{Concentrated GMM for Higher-Order Paths}
\label{sec:concentrated}
While the ratio estimator \eqref{eq:rho2-est} provides a constructive solution, concentrated GMM becomes useful when incorporating higher-order covariances (6-step, 8-step, etc.) or handling measurement error. The structure of the moment conditions permits analytical concentration: for any candidate $\rho$, solve for $(\sigma_a,\sigma_z,\sigma_\varepsilon)$ in closed form.

For fixed $\rho$, the difference of excess-variance identities \eqref{eq:excess-mm2} and \eqref{eq:excess-ff2} yields
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigma-diff}
 \sigma_z^2(\rho) - \sigma_a^2(\rho) = \frac{\widehat C_{\text{ff},2} - \widehat C_{\text{mm},2}}{1-\rho^2}.
\end{equation}
The 2-step covariances sum to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sum-cov2}
 \widehat C_{\text{mm},2} + \widehat C_{\text{ff},2} = (1+\rho^2)(\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_z^2) + 4\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z.
\end{equation}
Denote $S \equiv \sigma_a^2 + \sigma_z^2$ and $D \equiv \sigma_z^2 - \sigma_a^2$. From \eqref{eq:sigma-diff}, $D$ is known given $\rho$. The product $\sigma_a\sigma_z = \sqrt{(\tfrac{S+D}{2})(\tfrac{S-D}{2})} = \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{S^2 - D^2}$. Substituting into \eqref{eq:sum-cov2} and solving for $S$ gives $\sigma_a^2(\rho) = (S-D)/2$ and $\sigma_z^2(\rho) = (S+D)/2$. Finally,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sigma-eps-rho}
 \sigma_\varepsilon^2(\rho) = \widehat V - \sigma_a^2(\rho) - \sigma_z^2(\rho) - 2\rho\,\sigma_a(\rho)\sigma_z(\rho).
\end{equation}

With $\theta(\rho) = (\sigma_a(\rho), \sigma_z(\rho), \sigma_\varepsilon(\rho))$ determined analytically, the GMM problem reduces to one-dimensional search over $\rho\in[-1,1]$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:concentrated-gmm}
 \widehat\rho_{\text{GMM}} = \arg\min_{\rho\in[-1,1]} Q(\rho),
\end{equation}
where $Q(\rho)$ is a weighted distance between observed and predicted 4-step (or higher-order) covariances. For $h$-step paths with $h>4$, the model implies $C_{k,h} = \rho^{h-2} C_{k,2}$, providing additional overidentifying restrictions. The concentrated approach is particularly valuable when:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Combining multiple path lengths to improve precision
 \item Testing overidentifying restrictions from longer paths
 \item Accommodating heteroskedasticity or clustering in the moment conditions
 \item Imposing additional structure (e.g., bounds on parameters)
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Implementation on Hungarian CEO--Firm Data}
\label{sec:implementation}
We implement the procedure on a comprehensive panel of Hungarian firms and CEOs spanning 1992--2021. The data come from the Hungarian tax authority and cover the near-universe of incorporated firms. For each firm-year, we observe the registered CEO (person identifier) and annual revenue. The panel is partitioned into ten non-overlapping three-year windows (1992--1994, 1995--1997, \ldots, 2019--2021). For each window we construct the bipartite mobility network, compute the five sample moments, and estimate $\theta$.

\subsection{Data construction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Outcome: $y_{im}$ is the log of real firm revenue aggregated over the window while manager $m$ is in office at firm $i$. We deflate nominal revenue using standard price indices. If a firm--manager relation spans multiple years within a window, we average log revenues or equivalently sum revenues and take logs; both are acceptable provided consistency across observations.
  \item Graphs: Build a bipartite incidence matrix $B$ of size (firms $\times$ managers) with $B_{im}=1$ if manager $m$ is observed at firm $i$ within the window. The manager projection is $W_M = B'B$ with diagonal set to zero; the firm projection is $W_F = BB'$ with diagonal set to zero.
  \item Two-step pairs: Manager pairs with $(W_M)_{mm'}>0$ and firm pairs with $(W_F)_{ii'}>0$ form the 2-step sets. For each pair, construct matched observations of $y$ from the relevant spells and compute sample covariances across pairs. We weight pairs equally; robustness checks consider degree-based weights.
  \item Four-step pairs: Use squared projection matrices $W_M^{(2)}=(W_M)^2$ and $W_F^{(2)}=(W_F)^2$; off-diagonal positive entries indicate existence of at least one length-4 path. Construct the set of unique pairs and compute sample covariances of $y$ across these pairs. We deduplicate multiple paths between the same pair.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation procedure}
\label{sec:estimation-procedure}
For each three-year window, we implement the following algorithm:

\paragraph{Step 1: Construct sample moments.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute $\widehat V$ as the sample variance of $y$ across all observed firm--manager spells in the window.
  \item Build projection matrices $W_M = D_M' D_M$ and $W_F = D_F' D_F$ where $D_M$ and $D_F$ are firm-manager incidence matrices.
  \item Compute $\widehat C_{\text{mm},2}$ and $\widehat C_{\text{ff},2}$ as sample covariances across pairs with $(W_M)_{mm'}>0$ and $(W_F)_{ii'}>0$.
  \item Compute $\widehat C_{\text{mm},4}$ and $\widehat C_{\text{ff},4}$ using squared projections $W_M^2$ and $W_F^2$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Step 2: Estimate sorting parameter.}
Average the two ratio estimators:
\begin{equation}
 \widehat{\rho^2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\widehat C_{\text{mm},4}}{\widehat C_{\text{mm},2}} + \frac{\widehat C_{\text{ff},4}}{\widehat C_{\text{ff},2}}\right).
\end{equation}
Set $\widehat\rho = \sqrt{\widehat{\rho^2}}$ with sign determined by the 2-step covariances.

\paragraph{Step 3: Recover variance components via grid search.}
The excess-variance equations \eqref{eq:excess-mm2} and \eqref{eq:excess-ff2} combined with the sum constraint \eqref{eq:sum-cov2} form an overidentified system. We grid-search over $\sigma_\varepsilon^2 \in [0, \min(\widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{mm},2}, \widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{ff},2})]$ and for each candidate compute:
\begin{align}
 \sigma_z^2(\sigma_\varepsilon^2) &= \frac{\widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{mm},2} - \sigma_\varepsilon^2}{1 - \widehat\rho^2}, \\
 \sigma_a^2(\sigma_\varepsilon^2) &= \frac{\widehat V - \widehat C_{\text{ff},2} - \sigma_\varepsilon^2}{1 - \widehat\rho^2}.
\end{align}
Select the value of $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ that minimizes the squared deviation between the observed and predicted sum of 2-step covariances:
\begin{equation}
 \widehat\sigma_\varepsilon^2 = \arg\min_{\sigma_\varepsilon^2} \left[\widehat C_{\text{mm},2} + \widehat C_{\text{ff},2} - (1+\widehat\rho^2)(\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_z^2) - 4\widehat\rho\,\sigma_a\sigma_z\right]^2.
\end{equation}
This approach is numerically stable when $\rho$ is close to unity, as in our data.

\paragraph{Step 4: Compute standard errors.}
Standard errors can be obtained via nonparametric bootstrap resampling by firm and manager blocks, or via a pairs-of-pairs bootstrap that preserves network dependence. For the current analysis we report point estimates; inference is deferred to future work.

\subsection{Practical considerations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Window length: Two- to four-year windows balance the need for stable revenue measurement and evolving network moments. The model assumes stationarity within a window.
  \item Multiple CEOs or co-management: If multiple managers serve concurrently, treat each manager--firm spell separately or aggregate to a primary manager; we will assess sensitivity.
  \item Outliers and winsorization: Winsorize extreme revenues symmetrically to reduce undue influence on variance and covariance estimates.
  \item Market coverage: Use the full universe of firms and managers; no sampling is required for identification.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Sample characteristics}
Table~\ref{tab:sample-stats} reports summary statistics by window. The full sample comprises 3.1 million firm-year observations spanning 985,000 unique firm-window-manager combinations. The average window contains 310,000 observations, 105,000 firms, and 129,000 managers. Network connectivity is high: manager-manager 2-step links average 350,000 pairs per window, while 4-step links average 330,000 pairs, indicating substantial mobility across the CEO labor market.

\end{table}

\subsection{Parameter estimates}
Table~\ref{tab:estimates} reports the estimated parameters for all ten windows. The key findings are:

\paragraph{Extremely strong positive sorting throughout.} The correlation parameter $\rho$ ranges from 0.988 to 0.991 across all windows, with no discernible time trend. This near-perfect correlation indicates that the best managers systematically work at the best firms. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, sorting strength did not increase during the market transition of the 1990s; rather, positive assortative matching was already maximal by 1992.

\paragraph{Manager heterogeneity dominates firm heterogeneity.} Manager effect standard deviations ($\sigma_z \approx 4$--6) vastly exceed firm effect standard deviations ($\sigma_a \approx 0.5$). Manager types vary by roughly an order of magnitude more than firm types. This suggests that CEO quality drives most of the cross-sectional variation in firm performance, consistent with models of superstar managers in frictional labor markets.

\paragraph{Moderate match-specific noise.} The match-specific component $\sigma_\varepsilon \approx 0.7$ is substantial but considerably smaller than manager heterogeneity. This indicates that while match quality matters beyond CEO and firm types, the systematic sorting components dominate.

\paragraph{Stability over thirty years.} All parameters are remarkably stable across the entire 1992--2021 period. Neither the market transition of the 1990s nor the financial crisis of 2008--2009 nor the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020--2021 altered the underlying structure of the CEO-firm matching process.

\subsection{Interpretation}
The near-perfect correlation ($\rho \approx 0.99$) combined with large manager variance relative to firm variance has important implications for understanding CEO labor markets and allocative efficiency:

\paragraph{High allocative efficiency.} The matching process achieves near-optimal sorting of CEOs to firms. Misallocation of CEO talent is minimal. This suggests that search frictions, information asymmetries, and other market imperfections do not substantially distort the allocation of managerial talent in the Hungarian economy.

\paragraph{CEO quality dominates.} The fact that $\sigma_z/\sigma_a \approx 10$ indicates that CEO heterogeneity accounts for most of the cross-sectional variation in firm performance. This is consistent with event study estimates showing that CEO transitions cause 5--6\% changes in firm revenue, while firm fixed effects are considerably smaller.

\paragraph{Limited scope for gains from improved matching.} Because sorting is already near-perfect, policies aimed at improving CEO-firm match quality are unlikely to generate large aggregate efficiency gains. The constraint on aggregate productivity is the supply of high-quality managers, not the allocation of existing managers.

\paragraph{Market maturity since transition.} The stability of all parameters from 1992 onward indicates that the Hungarian CEO labor market reached its steady-state matching equilibrium rapidly after the transition to a market economy. This is consistent with rapid price liberalization and minimal institutional barriers to managerial mobility.

\section{Robustness and Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Higher-order links: Following \citet{Clark2023}'s approach of using multiple path lengths to measure correlation, extend to 6-step, 8-step, and longer covariances. Under the model, manager--manager covariances at length $2h$ follow $\rho^{h-1} C_{\text{mm},2}$ (and symmetrically for firm--firm). Overidentification tests assess model fit.
  \item Alternative outcomes: Replace revenue with value added or profits to assess sensitivity to accounting practices.
  \item Selection and mobility frictions: Short windows mitigate time variation in types; incorporating explicit dynamics (e.g., Choo--Siow assignment with Calvo separations) can microfound $\rho$ and link it to frictions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We develop a variance-covariance decomposition method to quantify sorting between firms and managers using only firm-level revenues and the topology of the CEO-firm mobility network. The approach avoids high-dimensional fixed effects estimation and scales to datasets with millions of observations. Applied to thirty years of Hungarian administrative data, we find near-perfect positive assortative matching ($\rho \approx 0.99$) throughout 1992--2021, with manager heterogeneity dominating firm heterogeneity by an order of magnitude. The stability of these parameters across major economic disruptions suggests the CEO labor market operates at a steady-state equilibrium with minimal allocative inefficiency.

The results complement placebo-controlled event study estimates showing modest causal effects of CEO quality on firm performance (5--6\%). Together, these findings imply that while CEO effects are real and sorting is near-optimal, the scope for improving aggregate productivity through better CEO-firm matching is limited. The binding constraint is the supply of high-quality managers, not their allocation.

Future work will extend the method to incorporate time-varying parameters, test overidentifying restrictions using higher-order network paths, and develop formal inference via bootstrap. The approach is portable to other settings with bipartite mobility networks, including worker-firm wage data, student-school achievement data, and patient-provider health outcomes.
