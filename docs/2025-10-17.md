# Manager-Firm Matching Quality Estimation via Network-Based Variance Decomposition

*Research Discussion Summary - October 17, 2025*

## Overview

This note presents a novel approach to estimating manager-firm matching quality using variance decomposition methods applied to network projections of manager-firm relationships. The methodology extends beyond traditional AKM regression approaches by exploiting higher-order network links to identify key structural parameters including the correlation between manager and firm quality, while accounting for measurement error through noise variance estimation.

## Model Specification

### Core Framework

The model decomposes log firm revenue into three components:

$$\ln Y_{imt} = A_i + Z_m + \epsilon_{imt}$$

where:
- $A_i$ represents the firm fixed effect (log firm productivity)
- $Z_m$ denotes the manager fixed effect (log manager skill)  
- $\epsilon_{imt}$ captures match-specific idiosyncratic productivity (noise)

### Key Assumptions

The framework treats this as a random effects model with the following distributional assumptions:

1. $A_i$ and $Z_m$ may be correlated with correlation coefficient $\rho$
2. $\epsilon_{imt}$ is uncorrelated with both $A_i$ and $Z_m$ (pure measurement error or idiosyncratic match productivity)
3. The noise component $\epsilon_{imt}$ may exhibit persistence over time but remains uncorrelated with systematic components

### Parameter Structure

The model contains four key structural parameters:
- $\sigma_A^2$: variance of firm fixed effects
- $\sigma_Z^2$: variance of manager fixed effects  
- $\rho$: correlation between firm and manager effects (primary object of interest)
- $\sigma_\epsilon^2$: variance of idiosyncratic noise

## Network Construction and Moment Conditions

### Bipartite Graph Representation

The estimation exploits a bipartite graph structure where managers and firms are connected through employment relationships. Two network projections are constructed:

1. **Manager-to-manager links**: Two managers are connected if they worked at the same firm
2. **Firm-to-firm links**: Two firms are connected if they employed the same manager

Analysis focuses on short time windows (2-4 years) to capture time-varying parameters while maintaining sufficient sample size.

### Primary Moment Conditions

#### Cross-Sectional Variance
The total variance of log revenue across all firm-manager pairs:

$$\text{Var}(\ln Y) = \sigma_A^2 + \sigma_Z^2 + 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_Z + \sigma_\epsilon^2$$

#### Manager-to-Manager Covariance (Second-Degree Links)
For managers $m_1$ and $m_2$ who worked at the same firm $i$:

$$\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{im_1}, \ln Y_{im_2}) = \sigma_A^2 + \rho^2\sigma_Z^2 + 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_Z$$

The key insight is that the correlation between manager effects is dampened to $\rho^2$ due to the projection through the firm effect.

#### Firm-to-Firm Covariance (Second-Degree Links)  
For firms $i_1$ and $i_2$ that employed the same manager $m$:

$$\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1 m}, \ln Y_{i_2 m}) = \sigma_Z^2 + \rho^2\sigma_A^2 + 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_Z$$

Similarly, the firm effect correlation is dampened to $\rho^2$ through the manager projection.

## Higher-Order Network Identification Strategy

### Noise Identification Problem

The basic moment conditions provide only three equations for four unknown parameters. The identification strategy follows Greg Clark's approach by exploiting higher-order network links to separate noise from systematic correlation effects.

### Fourth-Degree Link Moments

#### Manager-to-Manager (Fourth-Degree)
For managers connected through a four-step path (manager $\rightarrow$ firm $\rightarrow$ manager $\rightarrow$ firm $\rightarrow$ manager):

$$\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{m_1}, \ln Y_{m_2})^{(4)} = \sigma_A^2 + \rho^4\sigma_Z^2 + 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_Z$$

#### Firm-to-Firm (Fourth-Degree)
For firms connected through a four-step path:

$$\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1}, \ln Y_{i_2})^{(4)} = \sigma_Z^2 + \rho^4\sigma_A^2 + 2\rho\sigma_A\sigma_Z$$

### Excess Variance Decomposition

The identification strategy computes excess variances by subtracting network covariances:

#### Manager Excess Variance
$$\text{Var}(\ln Y) - \text{Cov}(\ln Y_{m_1}, \ln Y_{m_2})^{(2)} = (1-\rho^2)\sigma_Z^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2$$

$$\text{Var}(\ln Y) - \text{Cov}(\ln Y_{m_1}, \ln Y_{m_2})^{(4)} = (1-\rho^4)\sigma_Z^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2$$

#### Firm Excess Variance
$$\text{Var}(\ln Y) - \text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1}, \ln Y_{i_2})^{(2)} = (1-\rho^2)\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2$$

$$\text{Var}(\ln Y) - \text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1}, \ln Y_{i_2})^{(4)} = (1-\rho^4)\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_\epsilon^2$$

## Complete Identification System

### Moment Vector
The estimation uses five moment conditions:
1. Cross-sectional variance: $\text{Var}(\ln Y)$
2. Manager 2nd-degree covariance: $\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{m_1}, \ln Y_{m_2})^{(2)}$
3. Manager 4th-degree covariance: $\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{m_1}, \ln Y_{m_2})^{(4)}$
4. Firm 2nd-degree covariance: $\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1}, \ln Y_{i_2})^{(2)}$
5. Firm 4th-degree covariance: $\text{Cov}(\ln Y_{i_1}, \ln Y_{i_2})^{(4)}$

### Parameter Recovery
With five moments and four parameters, the system is exactly identified. The noise variance $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ is identified from the differential dampening pattern: systematic correlations decay as $\rho^{2k}$ for $k$-th order links, while noise remains constant across all network distances.

### Robustness Extensions
Additional moments using sixth-degree links can be incorporated for over-identification and specification testing, allowing verification that the model fits the observed dampening pattern accurately.

## Empirical Implementation Plan

### Data Structure
- **Sample**: Complete universe of Hungarian firms and managers (approximately 1 million each)
- **Time horizon**: 30-year panel (1990-2020)  
- **Window specification**: Non-overlapping 3-year periods yielding 10 estimation windows
- **Outcome variable**: Log firm revenue

### Expected Results and Hypotheses

#### Correlation Evolution
The primary hypothesis concerns the time evolution of $\rho$:
- **Early transition period (1990s)**: Low correlation due to market disruption and poor matching
- **Market maturation**: Increasing correlation as institutional development improves allocative efficiency
- **Steady state**: High positive correlation reflecting efficient manager-firm sorting

#### Noise Correction Importance
The methodology expects significant noise correction effects. Preliminary evidence from high covariances between successive managers at the same firm (which depends on $\rho^2$) suggests substantial underlying correlation masked by measurement error in traditional approaches.

#### Variance Component Stability
Manager and firm variance components ($\sigma_A^2$, $\sigma_Z^2$) are hypothesized to remain relatively stable compared to the correlation parameter, with the noise variance potentially changing as data quality and reporting standards evolve.

### Technical Implementation

#### Computational Approach
The estimation will be implemented in Stata using the complete firm-manager panel. The network construction and moment calculation should be computationally feasible given the relatively simple covariance structure.

#### Mean Estimation
Window-specific means can be estimated using traditional fixed effects approaches, though the focus remains on second-moment identification of the variance-covariance structure.

## Connection to Broader Research Program

This variance decomposition approach complements the Choo-Siow-Calvo structural modeling framework by providing reduced-form evidence on matching quality evolution. The correlation parameter $\rho$ estimated here corresponds to the sorting strength parameter in the structural model, enabling validation of theoretical predictions about matching efficiency during economic transition.

The methodology's simplicity relative to full structural estimation makes it particularly suitable for documenting empirical patterns across the complete 30-year transition period, providing stylized facts to inform and discipline the more complex structural analysis.

## Methodological Contribution

The approach makes three key methodological advances:

1. **Network-based identification**: Exploits graph structure of employment relationships rather than relying solely on time-series variation
2. **Higher-order link utilization**: Uses dampening patterns across network distances to separate systematic correlation from noise
3. **Comprehensive noise correction**: Accounts for measurement error that contaminates traditional fixed effects estimates

This framework provides a robust foundation for understanding manager-firm matching quality evolution during major economic transitions while maintaining computational tractability for large-scale datasets.
