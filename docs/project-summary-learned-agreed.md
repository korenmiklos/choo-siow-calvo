[[ERC-2023-AdG]] ### Misallocation of Managers and Firms - Beyond AKM Regression**What we learned:**- Traditional AKM (Abowd-Kramarz-Margolis) fixed effects approaches suffer from severe downward bias in estimating firm-manager correlations- Perfect assortative matching models (without frictions) produce unrealistic predictions where single entry/exit events trigger complete reallocation- Existing friction models (Shimer-Smith 2000) are computationally complex and difficult to implement**What we agreed on:**- Develop Choo-Siow framework with frictions for manager-firm matching- Use Gumbel-distributed idiosyncratic matching costs for both firms and managers- Single friction parameter (sigma) controls degree of assortative matching- As sigma approaches zero: perfect assortative matching; as sigma increases: more random assignment### Optimal Transport Theory Applications**What we learned:**- Alfred Galichon's framework demonstrates that 90% of economics problems are optimal transport problems- Monge-Kantorovich duality theorem provides foundation for assignment models with equilibrium wages and firm profits- Frictionless optimal transport gives unique solutions under convexity conditions but lacks realism**What we agreed on:**- Incorporate Choo-Siow matching probabilities: μ(a,z) = exp(az/σ)Φ(a)φ(z)- Wages cancel out in assignment probabilities (transferability property)- Framework applicable to discrete choice, Roy models, and non-parametric econometrics### Dynamic Extensions with Calvo-Style Match Dissolution**What we learned:**- Static models insufficient for understanding manager mobility patterns- Random match dissolution (Poisson rate λ) creates representative sample of unmatched agents- Mobility patterns non-random but dissolution process provides identification**What we agreed on:**- Implement "fake dynamics" where matches dissolve randomly but reformation follows optimal assignment- Newly dissolved agents represent random sample, enabling fixed effects identification- Framework generates testable implications about sorting strength and friction evolution over time## Empirical Applications and Data Projects### Manager Quality Identification from Switching Patterns**What we learned:**- Joint distribution of manager skills (z) and firm productivity (a) identifiable from three moments:  1. Firm-to-firm mobility variance  2. Manager-to-manager mobility variance    3. Cross-sectional revenue variance- Hungarian data shows increasing correlation between firm productivity and manager quality over 1990s**What we agreed on:**- Estimate variance of ln(a), variance of ln(z), and correlation coefficient ρ- Use mobility patterns rather than exact fixed effects ("random effects model")- Framework allows adding observables (foreign vs domestic managers, groups, time trends)
