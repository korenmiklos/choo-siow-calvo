## Steady-state switchingIn steady state, some matches are dissolved and new ones are formed. Let's follow a firm through such a process.Dissolving firms are a random sample of all firm-manager pairs. So the joint distribution of firm productivities and manager skills is $\mu^*(a,z)$. The distribution of sales is$$\Pr[Q \le q] = \int_0^\infty \int_0^{q/a} 	\mu^*(a,z) dz da$$The next match is also going to be drawn from $\mu^*(a,z)$ but for the same $a$. > NOT QUITE: we need to divide by the sume of mu across firm pairs. We **normalize** $\iint \mu^*(a,z)dadz=1$.The joint distribution of $Q$ and $Q'$ is$$\Pr(Q\le q, Q' \le q') = \int_a\Pr(Q\le q, Q' \le q'|a) f(a)da.$$Conditional on $a$, the two events are independent, so the probability of both happening is the product of the probabilities.$$\Pr(Q\le q, Q' \le q'|a) = \Pr(Q\le q|a)Pr(Q\le q'|a)=	\frac {\int_0^{q/a} \mu^*(a,z)dz}		{\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}	\frac {\int_0^{q'/a} \mu^*(a,z)dz}		{\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}$$The density of $a$ is $f(a) = \int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz$.$$F(Q,Q') = \int_a	\frac {\int_0^{q/a} \mu^*(a,z)dz\int_0^{q'/a} \mu^*(a,z)dz}		{\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}da$$To derive the joint density function,$$F_1(q,q') = \int_a	\frac {\mu^*(a,q/a)\int_0^{q'/a} \mu^*(a,z)dz}		{a\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}da$$$$F_{12}(q,q') = f(q,q')=\int_a	\frac {\mu^*(a,q/a)\mu^*(a,q'/a)}		{a^2\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}da$$$$\mu^*(a,q/a) =  e^{q/2\sigma}\sqrt{\phi(q/a)\Phi(a)}.$$factor out terms independentof $a$$$f(q,q')=e^{(q+q')/2\sigma}\int_a	\frac {\sqrt{\phi(q/a)\phi(q'/a)}\Phi(a)}		{a^2\int_0^{\infty} \mu^*(a,z)dz}da$$
