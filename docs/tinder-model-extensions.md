## The Tinder modelUnemployed managers get the possibility to pick a fim with Poisson arrival $\lambda_2$. They draw a firm from logit $\pi(a,z)$. Empty firms get to pick with Poisson arrival $\lambda_1$. They draw a manager from logit $\Pi(a,z)$. A match is formed if both sides picked one another, with probability $\pi(a,z)\Pi(a,z)$. Challenge: the value of picking firm $a$ depends on the probability whether they accept, $\Pi(a,z)$. If they don't accept, the manager goes back to being unemployed and spend some time there. This is not an issue in Choo-Siow because it is a static model. Probably if $\rho=0$, we get back Choo-Siow.Let's try a Bellman. Value of being in a match for a manager is $V(a,z)$. Value of "swiping right" is$$\tilde V(a, z) = \Pi(a,z)V(a,z) + [1-\Pi(a,z)] V_0(z)$$so that$$\tilde V(a,z)-V_0(z) = \Pi(a,z)[V(a,z) - V_0(z)].$$Logit:$$\pi(a,z) \propto e^{\Pi(a,z)} V_0(z)].$$Logit:$$\pi(a,z) \propto e^{\Pi(a,z)V(a,z)}/e^{\Pi(a,z)V_0(z)}$$This hopelessly depends on $\Pi$. Maybe I just don't understand Choo-Siow. There are no two independent draws.
