# Meeting Notes - October 28, 2025

## Date and Participants
- **Date**: October 28, 2025
- **Participants**: Speaker 1 (Primary), Speaker 2

## Key Discussion Topics

### Three-Hop Covariance Derivation
- Speaker 2 presented completed three-hop covariance calculations
- Mathematical validation confirmed correctness through intuitive reasoning
- First term involves sigma squared times two times sum of variances  
- Additional third-order terms in rho identified as expected
- Extensive probing performed to verify accuracy

### Documentation and File Organization
- Discussion on placement of full mathematical derivation (previously brief in issue tracker)
- Decision to utilize existing `docs/` folder for documentation
- Established practice of committing documentation directly to main branch
- Meeting transcripts to be saved in `docs/` with date-based naming convention

### Network Analysis Implementation
- Review of AMM (manager-manager) and AFF (firm-firm) matrix computations
- Discussion of component identification and filtering strategies
- Implementation of edge-level outcome tracking for validation purposes

## Technical Content

### Mathematical Framework
- Three-hop covariance contains expected sigma squared terms plus third-order rho terms
- Four-hop computation involves squaring AMM/AFF matrices and subtracting direct links
- Cycles in network create non-Markovian characteristics requiring careful theoretical treatment
- Potential reformulation as Markovian GMRF plus noise layer discussed

### Network Structure Analysis
- Identification of isolated two-hop connections that do not generate four-hop paths
- Component size analysis needed to understand network connectivity
- Multiple paths between same manager pairs treated as additional samples from underlying distribution
- Path length decay provides key identification through covariance attenuation

### Sampling and Filtering Strategy
- Remove small components (particularly size-2 components with solo firms)
- Retain managers/firms present in four-hop computations
- Apply temporal restrictions (post-EU accession, 2004+ for stable economy period)
- Implement deflation by subtracting yearly averages to remove temporal trends

### Estimation Architecture
- Modular design with parameterized admissible manager/firm lists
- Separation of computational functions from data filtering logic
- Matrix-based computation independent of data structure details
- Multiple estimation approaches: constructive method of moments, minimum distance estimation

## Decisions Made

### Branch Management
- Merged pipeline branch into main
- Closed pipeline pull request
- Future work to proceed directly on main branch for documentation

### Code Architecture
- Implement generic machinery with parameterized node lists
- Create function-based approach: input network, output all moments and estimated parameters
- Maintain intermediate connection tracking for validation

### Estimation Strategy
- Begin with constructive method of moments estimation for primary results
- Develop minimum distance estimator as robustness check
- Use concentrated estimator approach with outer loop over rho parameter
- Grid search acceptable for bounded rho parameter

## Action Items

### Speaker 2 Responsibilities
- Complete temporal deflation (subtract yearly averages) - targeted for same day
- Implement component size analysis and filtering
- Develop modular estimation functions
- Create method of moments estimator
- Re-parameterize functions for flexibility
- Ensure full pipeline reproducibility

### Documentation Tasks
- Create markdown document with full three-hop derivation in `docs/` folder
- Maintain meeting notes in standardized format

### Technical Validation
- Verify covariance behavior with deflation (should decrease with network distance)
- Test multiple sample restrictions (component size, temporal windows)
- Validate matrix algebra for four-hop computation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
- Complete n-hop computation functionality
- Verify covariance patterns behave as expected with deflation
- Begin method of moments estimator implementation

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 Weeks)
- Develop minimum distance estimation framework
- Complete parameterization of filtering functions
- Perform robustness checks across different sample restrictions

### Paper Timeline Discussion
- Original target: November 7 submission to PNAS
- Revised timeline: November 14 due to teaching and conference constraints
- Full week of concentrated work needed for completion
- Both authors have Monday teaching commitments affecting schedule

### Methodological Questions for Further Investigation
- Formal verification of Markovian properties with network cycles
- Optimal weighting matrix for minimum distance estimation
- Sensitivity analysis across different temporal windows
- Component size thresholds for sample inclusion

## Procurement and Administrative Notes
- Outstanding procurement materials from October 22 meeting
- Server environment setup discussion scheduled for Thursday meeting
- Database upgrade considerations for DuckDB functionality
- Git timestamp preservation for make file dependency tracking identified as future enhancement
