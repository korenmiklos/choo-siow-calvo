  abstract = "This paper investigates whether and how individual managers
              affect corporate behavior and performance. We construct a
              manager-firm matched panel data set which enables us to track the
              top managers across different firms over time. We find that
              manager fixed effects matter for a wide range of corporate
              decisions. A significant extent of the heterogeneity in
              investment, financial, and organizational practices of firms can
              be explained by the presence of manager fixed effects. We
              identify specific patterns in managerial decision-making that
              appear to indicate general differences in ``style'' across
              managers. Moreover, we show that management style is
              significantly related to manager fixed effects in performance and
              that managers with higher performance fixed effects receive
              higher compensation and are more likely to be found in better
              governed firms. In a final step, we tie back these findings to
              observable managerial characteristics. We find that executives
              from earlier birth cohorts appear on average to be more
              conservative; on the other hand, managers who hold an MBA degree
              seem to follow on average more aggressive strategies.",

               percent, about one-half of which is due to imperfect substitution
               between foreign and domestic inputs. Foreign firms use imports
               more effectively and pay lower fixed import costs. We attribute
               one-quarter of Hungarian productivity growth during the 1993-2002
               period to imported inputs. Simulations show that the productivity
               gain from a tariff cut is larger when the economy has many

               Whether stronger governance improves retain/replace decisions

               the possibility that the CEO effect might differ in publicly

               using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level
               productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and

               a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production

               statistical model of earnings determination with worker and firm
               fixed effects. Estimates based on this model have produced
               influential yet controversial conclusions. The objective of this
               paper is to assess the sensitivity of these conclusions to the
               biases that arise because of limited mobility of workers across
               firms. We use employer-employee data from the United States and
               several European countries while taking advantage of both fixed
               effects and random effects methods for bias correction. We find
               that limited mobility bias is severe and that bias correction is
               important.",

               shareholder value in the typical firm by 1.74\%, making CEOs risk
               neutral increases shareholder value by 16.12\%, and removing all

               dataset on privately-held and public firm CEO annual compensation
               over the period 1999–2011. We first show that CEOs in public
               firms are paid 30\% more than CEOs in comparable privately-held
               firms. We further show that both private and public firm CEO pays
               are positively and significantly related to firm accounting
               performance, and that the pay–performance link is much weaker in
               privately-held firms. We then show that the above findings are
               robust to accounting for firms' self-selection into being
               privately-held, and a number of important differences between
               privately-held and public firms, including CEO ownership,
               employee stock ownership, stock liquidity, discipline from the
               takeover market, and the availability of different performance
               measures. Overall, our results support the view that concentrated
               ownership substitutes for CEO performance-based compensation
